# Foundations-of-Deep-Learning-Digit-Recognition-XOR-Networks
Repository for our deep learning experiments. Contains notebooks for Task 1—data visualization, dimensionality reduction, and distance-based classifiers; Task 2—a multi-class perceptron from scratch; Task 3—an XOR network using gradient descent. These projects build foundational DL insights.
