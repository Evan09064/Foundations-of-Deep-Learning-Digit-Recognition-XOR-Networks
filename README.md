# Deep Learning Assignment 0 – Group 36

## About
This repository contains our work for Assignment 0 of the Introduction to Deep Learning course. It includes:
- A group report detailing our experiments on handwritten digit classification and our custom neural network implementations.
- Jupyter notebooks for each task:
  - **Task 1:** Experiments with data dimensionality, distance-based classifiers, and visualization using PCA, t-SNE, and U-MAP.
  - **Task 2:** Implementation of a multi-class perceptron from scratch.
  - **Task 3:** Building and training an XOR network using gradient descent.
  
The experiments provided us with foundational insights into classical machine learning techniques and neural network training, forming a base for more advanced deep learning projects.

## Repository Structure
All files are located in the root of the repository for easy access:
- `A0_Task1.ipynb` – Notebook for Task 1 (data visualization and distance-based classifiers).
- `A0_Task2.ipynb` – Notebook for Task 2 (multi-class perceptron implementation).
- `A0_Task3.ipynb` – Notebook for Task 3 (XOR network and gradient descent).
- `A0_Group36_Report.pdf` – Group report and analysis for Assignment 0.
- `README.md` – This file, which explains the project, structure, and instructions.

## How to Run
Each Jupyter notebook is self-contained. To reproduce our results:
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Run all cells in sequence.
3. Refer to the report for detailed explanations of the experiments and results.
